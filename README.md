# 2nd_Row_Data
Dataset for "New generation of effective core potentials from correlated calculations: 2nd row elements"

Contained in the 'Molpro' directory is the full set of Molpro input (filename.com) and output (filename.{out,xml}) files 
used in the study including any ancillary files such as basis set inputs, etc.. All molecular, atomic spectra and atomic 
total energy calculations are represented in these files. The two directories 'Spectra' and 'Molecules' contain the 
compiled CCSD(T) energies for all core approximations. Within the 'Spectra' directory, all electron affinities and 
ionization potentials are given for each atom and each core approximation. Within the 'Molecules' directory, all binding 
energies are given for each molecule and core approximation.
