# 2nd_Row_Data
Dataset for "New generation of effective core potentials from correlated calculations: 2nd row elements"

Contained in the 'Molpro' directory is the full set of Molpro input (filename.com) and output (filename.{out,xml}) files 
used in the study. All molecular, atomic spectra and atomic total energy calculations are represented in these files.
The two directories 'Spectra' and 'Molecules' contain the compiled CCSD(T) energies for all core approximations.
